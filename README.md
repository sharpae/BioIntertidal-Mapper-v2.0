# BioIntertidal Mapper v2.0 (with GUI)

## Description
BioIntertidal Mapper is a user-friendly tool, with a graphical user interface, that automates the selection and processing of Sentinel-2 imagery, to generate intertidal habitat maps. The software uses Google Earth Engine API and the WorldTides API to select imagery acquired at low tide within a specified timeframe. These images are subsequently processed to calculate a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is masked, based on a shapefile defining the area of interest. Maps are exported to a Google Drive folder. The program offers a simple solution for scientific and environmental manager to map intertidal photosynthetic communities, i.e. microphytobenthos, seaweeds, seagrasses, habitats using free and publicly available satellite imagery.
